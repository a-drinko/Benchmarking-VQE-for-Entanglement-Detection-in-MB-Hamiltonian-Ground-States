Codes used in "Benchmarking Variational Qquantum Eigensolvers for Entanglement Detection in Many-body Hamiltonian Ground States"

Each code needs a folder named as the "Ansatz" -> "Temporary_Files" to run the VQE, save the paralllel execution of all 250 random starts and import to plots and statiltical analisis. 

The file "HEA-sep 2 a 15 qbits.txt" have the VQE of separable energy, used to detec entanglement.
the file "Heisenberg Eigenvalues, J=-1, h=0.txt" have the ground state energy calculated numerically
