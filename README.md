Codes used in "Benchmarking Variational Qquantum Eigensolvers for Entanglement Detection in Many-body Hamiltonian Ground States"

Each code needs a folder named as the "Ansatz" -> "Temporary_Files" to run the VQE, save the paralllel execution of all 250 random starts and import to plots and statiltical analisis.
